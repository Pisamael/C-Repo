Aim: 
To demonstrate the use of switch statements in performing arithmetic operations based on user 
input. 
Algorithm: 
Step 1: Start the program. 
Step 2: Prompt the user to enter two numbers. 
Step 3: Display a menu of arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). 
Step 4: Read the user's choice. 
Step  5:  Based  on  the  user's  choice,  use  a  switch  statement  to  perform  the  corresponding 
arithmetic operation. 
Step 6: Display the result of the operation. 
Step 7: Stop the program. 
C Program: 
#include <stdio.h> 
int main() { 
    float num1, num2, result; 
    int choice; 
 
    printf("Enter two numbers: "); 
    scanf("%f %f", &num1, &num2); 
 
    printf("\nSelect the operation:\n"); 
    printf("1. Addition\n"); 
    printf("2. Subtraction\n"); 
    printf("3. Multiplication\n"); 
    printf("4. Division\n"); 
    printf("Enter your choice (1-4): "); 
    scanf("%d", &choice); 
 
    // Switch statement for performing the operation 
    switch (choice) { 
        case 1: 
            result = num1 + num2; 
            printf("Result: %.2f + %.2f = %.2f\n", num1, num2, result); 
            break; 
        case 2: 
            result = num1 - num2; 
            printf("Result: %.2f - %.2f = %.2f\n", num1, num2, result); 
            break; 
        case 3: 
            result = num1 * num2; 
            printf("Result: %.2f * %.2f = %.2f\n", num1, num2, result); 
            break; 
        case 4: 
            if (num2 != 0) { 
                result = num1 / num2; 
                printf("Result: %.2f / %.2f = %.2f\n", num1, num2, result); 
            } else { 
                printf("Error! Division by zero is not possible.\n"); 
            } 
            break; 
        default: 
            printf("Invalid choice! Please select a valid operation.\n"); 
    } 
 
    return 0; 
} 
 
Output: 
Enter two numbers: 12      
8 
Select the operation: 
1. Addition 
2. Subtraction 
3. Multiplication 
4. Division 
Enter your choice (1-4): 2

2.  Read an integer number from the user. 
3.  Check if the number is less than or equal to 1. If so, it is not prime. 
4.  Check if the number is 2 or 3, which are prime. 
5.  For numbers greater than 3, check divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number. 
6.  If the number is divisible by any number in that range, it is not prime.

1.  Start. 
2.  Read a string from the user. 
3.  Initialize two pointers: one at the beginning of the string and the other at the end. 
4.  Compare the characters at the two pointers: 
o  If they are the same, move the left pointer one step forward and the right pointer 
one step backward. 
o  If they are not the same, the string is not a palindrome. 
5.  If  all  character  comparisons  are  successful  (i.e.,  the  characters  at  corresponding 
positions are the same), the string is a palindrome.

8. Write a C program to Calculate GCD and LCM of two numbers. 
Aim: 
To write a C program that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common 
Multiple (LCM) of two integers. 
Algorithm: 
1.  For GCD: 
o  Start by reading two integers a and b. 
o  Use  the  Euclidean  algorithm  to  find  the  GCD.  This  algorithm  works  by 
repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the larger number 
divided by the smaller number, until one of the numbers becomes 0. The other 
number will be the GCD. 
2.  For LCM: 
o  Use the formula LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b) to calculate the LCM after 
calculating the GCD. 
3.  Display the values of GCD and LCM. 
4.  End. 
C Program: 
 
#include <stdio.h> 
 
int gcd(int a, int b) { 
    while (b != 0) { 
        int temp = b; 
        b = a % b; 
        a = temp; 
    } 
    return a; 
} 
 
int lcm(int a, int b, int gcd_val) { 
    return (a * b) / gcd_val; 
} 
 
int main() { 
    int a, b; 
    printf("Enter two integers: "); 
    scanf("%d %d", &a, &b); 
    int gcd_val = gcd(a, b); 
    int lcm_val = lcm(a, b, gcd_val); 
    printf("GCD of %d and %d is: %d\n", a, b, gcd_val); 
    printf("LCM of %d and %d is: %d\n", a, b, lcm_val); 
    return 0; 
} 
 
Output: 
Example 1: 
Enter two integers: 12 15 
GCD of 12 and 15 is: 3 
LCM of 12 and 15 is: 60 
LCM of 7 and 14 is: 14 
Example 2: 
Enter two integers: 25 30 
GCD of 25 and 30 is: 5 
LCM of 25 and 30 is: 150 
Result: 
Thus, the program correctly calculates the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm and computes 
the LCM using the relationship between GCD and LC
